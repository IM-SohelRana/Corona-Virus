# COVID-19_outbreak_analysing_prediction_using_ML for Bangladesh

## Goals
- To collect data from authentic sources for helping public health researchers.
- Collecting, analyzing and making predictions 
- Analysing the present condition in Bangladesh
- Forecasting the Bangladesh COVID-19 cases using SVM,Polynomial Regression,Linear Regression
- To find insights from datasets 

## Directory Structure

## Dashboards 
<p align="justify">
The World Health Organization (WHO), researchers from Johns Hopkins University, and other institutions all maintain datasets on the number of cases, deaths, and recoveries from the disease These are made in a number of useful dashboards and websites listed below.

Because these helpful tools already exist, we at HSTU resouce center  will not publish yet another dashboard or data tracker. But we have a plan to create a dashboard for tracking the coronavirus cases in Bangladesh and other country/region as well. Instead we list available data sources below and embed the dashboards from Johns Hopkins University, WHO, and HealthMap.
